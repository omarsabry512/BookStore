             Established in 1935, Ted's Book Store started with one man.. Ted!. Ted was a book collector trading in rare texts, and would accept nothing less than the most valuable books. <br /><br />
             In 1960 Ted stumbled upon the only existing copy of Einstiens memoirs and after selling for millions, was able to found one of the largest book distributors in history, taking his rare collecting standards to a mass production scale.<br /><br />
             10 years ago Ted passed but his memory will never be forgotten thanks to Ted's Book Store's strong reputation and quality products and services.
